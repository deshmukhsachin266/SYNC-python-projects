- tkinter library (can be installed via `pip install tkinter`)



- # OTP Verification Application

This is a simple OTP verification application in Python using the smtplib library to send an OTP via email.

## Requirements

# URL Shortener GUI

A simple URL shortener graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python and Tkinter. This application allows users to enter a long URL and get the shortened URL using the `pyshorteners` library and the TinyURL service.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyshorteners` library (install using `pip install pyshorteners`)

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the Python script: `python url_shortener.py`
2. Enter the long URL in the provided input box.
3. Click the "Shorten" button.
4. The shortened URL will be displayed in the output box.

## Error Handling

- If you try to submit without entering a URL, an error message will be shown.

- If there's any unexpected error during the shortening process, an error message with the specific error will be shown.



# Build Your own Chatbot

This is a simple rule-based chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined rules and provides responses accordingly. It serves as a basic example of a chatbot and can be expanded upon for more complex interactions.

Getting Started
Clone the repository or copy the code into your local environment.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
How to Use
Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

Run the chatbot script by executing the following command:
python chatbot.py
The chatbot will greet you with a message: "Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you? (Type 'bye' to exit)".

Type your message as input and press Enter to see the chatbot's response.

Continue the conversation until you want to exit. To end the conversation, type "bye" and press Enter.

Sample Interactions
Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you? (Type 'bye' to exit)
You: Hello
Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you?

You: How are you?
Chatbot: I'm just a bot, but thanks for asking!

You: What is the weather like today?
Chatbot: I'm sorry, I don't understand that.

You: Bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day.
